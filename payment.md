# Payment and Strong-customer-authentication for the eIDAS2 EUDI Wallet

## Abstract
Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is a crucial requirement under the Revised Payment Service Directive (PSD2) aimed at enhancing the security of electronic payments. To meet SCA standards in open banking, banks must implement multi-factor authentication, typically involving two out of three factors: 

- knowledge (e.g., password or PIN)
- possession (e.g., mobile phone)
- and inherence (e.g., biometrics like fingerprint or facial recognition). 

This additional layer of security is essential to combat fraud in online transactions and protect both financial institutions and consumers. Today there exist multiple ways on how SCA can be performed. 

- **Redirected**: The Redirected SCA approach described in XS2A section 5.1.1[^xs2a] involves redirecting users to their bank's authentication interface during a payment transaction to complete the authorization process. This method presents a pre-populated credit transfer screen for the user's confirmation, making it a semi-automated process where the flow is controlled by the user, initiating the payment themselves Embedded
- **Embedded**: The Embedded SCA approach described in XS2A section 5.1.8[^xs2a] involves a fully automated process where the payment is initiated on behalf of the Payment Service User (PSU) by the Third-Party Provider (TPP). In this method, the user shares their credentials with the TPP, who then authenticates and initiates the payment in the background, embedding the authentication process seamlessly within the transaction flow.
- **Decoupled**: The Decoupled approach described in XS2A section 5.1.7[^xs2a] offers a convenient method to obtain SCA approval with minimal effort from the merchant or cardholder. This approach allows transactions to occur without the cardholder being actively engaged with the merchant's website or mobile application. Instead, authentication is conducted through alternative channels, such as mobile push notifications within banking apps, email, or other methods chosen by the Issuer bank to inform the cardholder of an authentication request from a merchant.


Dynamic linking is another key requirement under the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) rules of the PSD2 for remote electronic payment transactions. It aims to ensure the integrity of the transaction by cryptographically linking the payment details to the customer's authentication. Here's how it works:

Dynamic linking requires at least two elements to be used for SCA compliance:

1. An authentication code or cryptogram that is uniquely linked to the specific payment amount and payee account. This is typically generated using the customer's authentication factors (e.g. biometrics, PIN, etc.)

2. The payment details themselves, including the amount and payee account details.

These two elements must be dynamically presented to the customer during authentication, ensuring they are verifying the actual payment details. The authentication code cryptographically binds the customer's identity to those payment specifics.

This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks where payment details could be modified after authentication. It also stops replay attacks reusing authentication codes across multiple transactions.

The dynamic linking process varies by authentication method, but often involves the customer's mobile app displaying the payment amount and merchant details alongside the authentication prompt. The authentication response then includes a cryptogram calculated over those payment details, dynamically linking them.

Article 5(1) of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/389 states that: Where payment service providers apply strong customer authentication in accordance with Article 97(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, in addition to the requirements of Article 4, they shall adopt security measures that meet each of the following requirements: 
1. the payer is made aware of the amount of the payment transaction and of the payee; 
2. the authentication code generated is specific to the amount of the payment transaction and the payee agreed to by the payer when initiating the transaction; 
3. the authentication code accepted by the payment service provider corresponds to the original specific amount of the payment transaction and to the identity of the payee agreed to by the payer; 
4. any change to the amount or the payee results in the invalidation of the authentication code generated.

In summary, dynamic linking is crucial for ensuring SCA provides true transaction integrity and non-repudiation under PSD2's remote electronic payment rules.

## eIDAS 2.0 

The European Digital Identity Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2024/1183) obliges European payment service providers (PSP) to accept the EU Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW) 
for SCA as [this paper](https://lange-hausstein.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/231120_DP-No.-1_EUDIW-for-SCA_EN_public.pdf) explains in more detail.

The Architecture Reference Framework[^arf] for the EUDIW published by the European Commisions proposes the protocols OpenID4VCI[^openid4vci] and OpenID4VP[^openid4vp] 
for the issuing and remote presentation of Electronic Attestations of Attributes (EAA). Therefor this document is focussing on the option to leverage these specifications
in order to introduce a standardized approach to allow compatible wallet applications to act as an authentication mean for SCA and payments relying on the following two factors:
- the wallets secure cryptographic device (WSCD) is used to securly generate and store a device-bound cryptographic key that is used to digitally sign a payment transaction (possesion) AND
- the access to the key stored in the wallets WSCD is protected by a PIN only known to the holder (knowledge) OR biometrics (inherence).

## Registration
Before the wallet can serve as a mean for SCA, it has to be registered with the issuer of the payment mean - typically the account serving bank of the payer. 
During the registration, the issuer is establishing a trusted context with the holder of the wallet. Exactly how this context is establish is left to the issuer and is out of the 
scope of this documents. However possible options and combinations of them are:

- Login credentials
- OTP
- 2FA Apps

Within the trusted context, the issuer issues a dedicated EAA (hereinafter called A2Pay - Attestation to pay) to the wallet using OpenID4VCI [^openid4vci] 
according to the OpenID4VC High Assurance Interoperability Profile using SD-JWT [^openid4vc_hip]. 
The A2Pay must be connected to a dedicated cryptographic key as also required by the ARF in section 6.3.2.4[^arf] stating that *"for each attestation, the EUDI Wallet Instance has access to an attestation private key, which is stored in the WSCD in (or connected to) the Userâ€™s device"*. 

![Registration](wallet_onboarding.svg)

### Attestation to pay - A2Pay

The A2Pay is issued by a bank or any other account serving enity. Its purpose is to indicate the payment method and the account used to make the payment.

See the schema file [a2pay-schema.json](a2pay-schema.json) for details.

```

1. The payee requests the presentation of an A2Pay as defined by OpenID4VP[^openid4vp] and the proposed extension for transaction data[^openid4vp_td] . The authorization request URL is tranmitted
    - **cross-device** by presenting it as a QR code / NFC Tag or
    - **same-device** by activating a link with a custom URL scheme.
2. `HTTP GET` to load the OpenID4VP authorization request object
3. `HTTP GET 200` response including the OpenID4VP authorization request object signed by the payee[^jar]. The included `presentation_definition` requests the presentation of a valid payment credential from the wallet.
4. Verify the signature of the authorisation request
5. Wallet requests consent to present the payment credential including the transaction data (payment details) from the payer.
6. Payer consents to the presentation.
7. `HTTP POST` OpenID4VP authorization response using `response_mode=direct_post`. The response includes a verifiable presentation of a payment credential. This will trigger the payment initiation.
8. Once the payee verified the presented payment credential, it initiates a payment using a payment initiation service provider (PISP) by forwarding the signed presentation of the Payment credential.
9. The PISP uses the information included in the payment credential to initiate a payment utilizing an OpenBanking API payment initiation request and forwarding the signed presentation of the Payment credential to the payers ASPSP.
10. The ASPSP verifies the signed presentation of the Payment credential using the public key exchanged during onboarding. Upon a succesful verification, the ASPSP executes the payment.
11. The ASPSP returns the status of the payment to the PISP
12. The PISP returns the status of the payment to the payee 
13. `HTTP POST` 200 OK indicating the payment was successful

The authorization request includes the transaction data within the presentation definition. The `transaction_data` array holds an object according to the payment data model scheme[^payment_data_model].

### Screenflow

Same-device screenflow of the payment process:

![Screenflow](screenflow.svg)

1. Merchant app initiates the process by requesting the presentation of a payment credential and including the transaction details.
2. Redirect to wallet. Wallet asking the payer to consent to the presentation of a payment credential and the transaction details. If more than one suitable payment credential is available, they have to choose one. 
    - Consent might include biometrics or PIN.
    - Consent must include biometrics or PIN.
3. Purchase is completed.

### OpenBanking support

Although currently there is no out of-the-box support for payment initiation using a verifiable presentation in existing OpenBanking standards like the Berlin Group yet, they already specify very similar concepts using a so called "signed payment request" within their Protocol Functions and Security Measures document for the  OpenFinance framework, section 7.1[^bg_sec]. A possible option would be to define an additional body signing profile for the `Body-Sig-Profile` parameter. The profile would define the requirements for wrapping the payment initiation requests into a verifiable presentation similar to the existing / forseen profiles `JAdES_JS`, `XAdES` and `EMV_AC`.
